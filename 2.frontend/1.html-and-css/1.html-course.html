They exactly function as div. At the same time they describe the purpose and content of their respective sections, making it easier for both developers and browsers to understand the structure of the page. -->
    <!-- Main: The content of a <main> element should be unique to the document. Content that is repeated across a set of documents or document sections such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms shouldn't be included unless the search form is the main function of the page. -->
    <!-- Nav: It's not necessary for all links to be contained in a <nav> element. <nav> is intended only for a major block of navigation links; typically the <footer> element often has a list of links that don't need to be in a <nav> element -->
    <!-- Section: As mentioned above, <section> is a generic sectioning element, and should only be used if there isn't a more specific element to represent it -->
    <!-- Article: Each <article> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<h1> - <h6> element) as a child of the <article> element. -->
    <!-- Aside: It represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes. -->

    <h2>10. Boxmodel</h2>
    <section class="boxmodel1">
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
            broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
            dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species,
            forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
            Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and
            keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans,
            lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="boxmodel2">
        <p>The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but
            when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion
            ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented
            populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on
            the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the
            early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the
            decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="boxmodel3">
        <p>One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in
            sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept
            in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in
            zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent
            in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's
            historic and current range.</p>

                    alt=""> On the beach, there is a weathered rock adorned with a mossy log. The rock, smoothed by the
                constant ebb and flow of the tides, sits proudly amidst the sandy shoreline. Its surface, once jagged
                and rough, has been gradually worn down, creating a sense of tranquility. Upon this rock, a mossy log
                has found its resting place. The log, covered in a lush carpet of vibrant green moss, seems to harmonize
                with the coastal environment. The moss cascades over the log's edges, forming delicate tendrils that
                sway gently in the sea breeze. The rock and the mossy log create an intriguing contrast against the
                sandy backdrop of the beach. The rock's muted tones of gray and beige provide a sturdy foundation, while
                the log's mossy embrace adds a burst of color and life. As the waves crash against the shore, the rock
                and its mossy companion stand as silent witnesses to the eternal dance between land and sea. Together,
                they create a picturesque scene, inviting contemplation and serving as a reminder of the beautiful
                interplay of nature's elements. Amidst the rhythmic lapping of the waves, the rock stands steadfast,
                offering a place of refuge for creatures seeking solace from the ever-changing tides. The mossy log, a
                testament to the passage of time, invites curious beachcombers to pause and marvel at its organic
                beauty. Soft to the touch, the moss on the log invites fingertips to explore its velvety texture. Tiny,
                delicate leaves interweave, creating a miniature forest atop the wooden surface. Moisture lingers in the
                air, nourishing the moss and giving it a vibrant sheen. In the golden light of the sun, the mossy log
                becomes a focal point of interest, captivating passersby with its whimsical charm. Seagulls perch
                nearby, occasionally hopping onto the log, creating a harmonious balance between the avian world and the
                moss-covered sanctuary. Over time, the mossy log and the rock have become inseparable, their destinies
                entwined in a timeless dance. Together, they tell a tale of resilience, growth, and symbiosis, reminding
                us of nature's ability to adapt and flourish in even the harshest environments. As day turns into night,
                the rock and its mossy companion rest beneath a star-studded sky, serenaded by the soothing sound of the
                ocean. In this tranquil moment, they serve as a gentle reminder of the beauty that can be found in the
                simplest of natural wonders, inspiring us to appreciate the intricate details that grace our world.</p>

                of the walls. The bench, crafted with care, offers a place to rest and contemplate within the comforting
                confines of the space. Its smooth surface bears the marks of time and use, adding character to its
                presence.Adorning the walls are an array of pictures, creating a gallery-like ambiance. Each picture
                tells its own story, capturing moments frozen in time. Some frames are ornate, exuding elegance, while
                others are simple and understated, allowing the focus to remain on the art they hold. The pictures
                themselves vary in style and subject matter. Landscapes transport the viewer to serene vistas, inviting

                a myriad of emotions. Abstract art, with its bold strokes and vibrant colors, sparks intrigue and

                visual stories presented before them. The interplay of light and shadow enhances the atmosphere, adding
                depth and dimension to the room's ambiance. The room, with its bench and pictures on the wall, becomes a

                    class="imgoverflow">The butterfly, a delicate and enchanting creature, dances gracefully through the
                air, captivating all who are fortunate enough to witness its flight. With its vibrant colors and
                intricate patterns, the butterfly is a symbol of beauty and transformation. From its humble beginnings
                as a caterpillar, the butterfly undergoes a remarkable metamorphosis, emerging from its chrysalis as a
                winged marvel. Its wings, adorned with a kaleidoscope of hues, range from iridescent blues and radiant
                oranges to soft pastels and striking blacks. Each species possesses its unique combination of colors and
                patterns, making every butterfly a work of art. As the butterfly flutters from flower to flower, it
                plays a vital role in pollination, aiding in the reproduction of plants. Its delicate legs and long
                proboscis allow it to delicately land on blossoms, sipping nectar with precision and grace. In this
                symbiotic dance between butterfly and plant, both species thrive and flourish. Butterflies are known for
                their ephemeral lifespan, living only for a brief period. Yet, during their time on Earth, they bring
                joy and wonder to the world. They serve as a gentle reminder to embrace change and embrace the fleeting
                beauty that life offers. Throughout various cultures, the butterfly holds symbolic significance. It
                represents transformation, rebirth, and the soul's journey. Its presence often evokes feelings of awe,
                freedom, and a connection to the natural world. Observing a butterfly's flight can be a moment of
                serenity and inspiration. It reminds us to appreciate the small wonders that surround us and to embrace
                our own personal growth and transformation. The butterfly's delicate presence serves as a reminder to
                live life with grace and to seek beauty in even the most fleeting moments.</p>

            Hard work can lead to numerous benefits and accomplishments. It can enhance skills, knowledge, and expertise
            in a particular area. It can also foster personal and professional development, instilling valuable
            qualities such as discipline, dedication, and self-confidence. Additionally, hard work can create
            opportunities, open doors, and increase the likelihood of achieving desired outcomes. However, it is

        <div class="grids" id="section-grids">
            Hard work is the dedicated effort and perseverance one puts into achieving their goals. It is the act of
            consistently exerting oneself to accomplish tasks and overcome challenges, often going beyond what is
            required. Hard work is characterized by commitment, discipline, and a strong work ethic. One of the key
            aspects of hard work is the willingness to put in the necessary time and energy to achieve success. It
            involves setting clear goals, planning strategically, and consistently taking steps towards those
            objectives. Hardworking individuals understand that achieving significant results requires sustained effort
            over a period of time. Hard work is not only about working long hours; it also entails working smartly and
            efficiently. It involves prioritizing tasks, managing time effectively, and focusing on activities that
            yield the greatest outcomes. By being organized and proactive, individuals can optimize their productivity
            and maximize the impact of their hard work. Moreover, hard work often requires perseverance and resilience
            in the face of challenges and setbacks. It is the ability to remain determined and motivated, even when
            faced with obstacles or failures. Hardworking individuals understand that setbacks are an inherent part of
            the journey towards success and view them as opportunities for growth and learning.
